# Safe Global Deployment

**NOTICE: This deployment is not production ready**

#### Deploying contracts

Make sure that the Web3 API supports batch requests with an `eth_gasPrice` call as one of the requests in the batch. See [here](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-evm-node/pull/340).

Add a new request in the [safe-singleton-factory](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new-chain&projects=&template=new_chain.yml&title=%5BNew+chain%5D%3A+) repo to support `exSat Mainnet` and follow the instructions in the issue template. See [exSat testnet request](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/issues/817) as an example.

After the `safe-singleton-factory` PR gets merged in clone [safe-smart-account](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account) repo and checkout the latest release tag.

Modify `package.json` to point to the master branch of `safe-singleton-factory` repo.

```diff
-        "@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory": "^1.0.33",
+        "@safe-global/safe-singleton-factory": "github:safe-global/safe-singleton-factory#main",
```

Set `MNEMONIC` in .env
Edit `hardhat.config.ts` add `exSat Mainnet` as a new network.

```diff=
         zkSyncSepolia: {
             ...sharedNetworkConfig,
             url: "https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev",
             ethNetwork: "goerli",
             zksync: true,
             verifyURL: "https://explorer.sepolia.era.zksync.dev/contract_verification",
         },
+         exSat: {
+             ...sharedNetworkConfig,
+             url: "https://evm.exsat.network/",
+         },
      },
      deterministicDeployment,
```

Fund with some native tokens the first account represented by `MNEMONIC`.

Deploy the contracts

```bash=
npm install
npm run build
npx hardhat --network exSat deploy
```

After the deployment completes, a list with the transaction id of each deployed contract will be returned by the script.

#### Updating safe-eth-py

Add a new request in the [safe-eth-py](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-eth-py/issues/new?assignees=&labels=add-new-address&projects=&template=add_safe_address_new_chain.yml&title=%5BNew+chain%5D%3A+%7Bchain+name%7D) repo to support `exSat Mainnet` and follow the instructions in the issue template. See [exSat testnet request](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-eth-py/issues/1495) as an example.


Wait for the `Validation successful!âœ…` message on the issue and for the automatically created PR to be merged on main.

Clone the `safe-eth-py` repo, checkout the main branch, build the python package and publish to the pip repository.

#### Updating safe-deployments

Clone the [safe-deployments](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments) repo and checkout the latest release tag.

Create a new branch and modify the following files to include the deployment information for `exSat Mainnet`. See [here](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments/pull/905/files) for the `exSat Testnet` example.

* src/assets/v1.4.1/compatibility_fallback_handler.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/create_call.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/multi_send.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/multi_send_call_only.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_l2.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_migration.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_proxy_factory.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_to_l2_migration.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/safe_to_l2_setup.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/sign_message_lib.json
* src/assets/v1.4.1/simulate_tx_accessor.json

commit, push and create a new PR.

Now we can wait for a new release of the `safe-deployments` from the safe-global team or build our own npm package and push it to the npm package repository.

_instruction on how to build and publish the npm package for the safe-deployments repo are skiped_

#### Use our safe-deployments and safe-eth-py packages

If we are not waiting for the updated releases of the safe-deployments and safe-eth-py, we need to update some projects that rely on them

###### protocol-kit (safe-global/safe-core-sdk)

This is the `@packages/protocol-kit` package located under the `packages/protocol-kit` of the safe-core-sdk repo.

Update safe-deployments to our npm package.

Build and publish the npm package.

###### safe-global/safe-wallet-web

Update safe-deployments to our npm package.

Update protocol-kit to our npm package. (the one that we build above)

Build docker image and publish to the docker repository.

###### safe-global/safe-client-gateway

Update safe-deployments to our npm package.

Build docker image and publish to the docker repository.

###### safe-global/safe-transaction-service

Update safe-eth-py to our pip package.

Build docker image and publish to the docker repository.

#### Deploy infrastructure

Clone the [safe-infrastructure](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-infrastructure) repo in the VM that will host the infrastructure.

Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and set the correct `RPC_NODE_URL`.

In `docker-compose.yaml`

 * Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAFE_VERSION=1.4.1`
 * Change the following docker images with the ones we built above
    * safeglobal/safe-wallet-web:${UI_VERSION}
    * safeglobal/safe-client-gateway-nest:${CGW_VERSION}
    * safeglobal/safe-transaction-service:${TXS_VERSION}
 * Add `processing` queue to the WORKER_QUEUES in `txs-worker-indexer`

    ```diff
    -      - WORKER_QUEUES=default,indexing
    +      - WORKER_QUEUES=default,indexing,processing
    ```

In `container_env_files/cgw.env` add:

```diff
+FINGERPRINT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
+JWT_ISSUER=your-jwt-issuer
+JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
+PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_API_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL=valid-email@example.com
```

In `container_env_files/ui.env` set
`NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID` with the wallet connect project ID.

Launch infrastructure with 
```bash=
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Configure safe-config-service

Open http://1.2.3.4/cfg/admin/

Create a new chain for exSat Mainnet.
Besides the self descriptive fields, be sure to:
* Check L2 checkbox
* Add a new feature called **SAFE_141** and assign it to the newly created chain
* Use http://nginx:8000/txs in `Transaction service uri`
* Use **1.4.1** in `Recommended master copy version.
