# Runbooks
This folder contains runbooks for common EOS-EVM operations.

_What are runbooks?_
> Runbooks are a type of document or manual used in IT operations and other technical fields to outline the necessary steps and procedures for carrying out a particular process or task. They are often created to ensure consistency and reduce errors by providing a standardized set of instructions that can be followed by anyone responsible for performing the task. Runbooks can be created for a wide variety of tasks, such as system maintenance, software deployment, incident response, and disaster recovery. They typically include detailed instructions, checklists, and troubleshooting tips to help ensure that tasks are carried out efficiently and effectively.

Our runbooks are as open as possible in the interest of transparency. However, runbooks may link to tables in private repos containing sensitive values where necessary. Secret values should never be committed to GitHub, secrets should be saved and shared using a password manager.
