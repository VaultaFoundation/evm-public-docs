# Cloud Infrastructure
EOS EVM public endpoint cloud infrastructure documentation.

> This repo is **public**, do not document [sensitive information](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/engineering/blob/main/standards/secrets.md) here!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> > As an open-source software organization funded by and with obligations to our community, we make as much information publicly available as possible. However, [sensitive details](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/engineering/blob/main/standards/secrets.md) are described using labels that are [distinct](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distinct) and [definite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/definite) without being [determinate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/determinate). Documentation in the private [eos-evm-internal](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-evm-internal/tree/main/cloud) repo maps the indeterminate labels to our implementation-specific details. All of these details would be different for anyone else deploying this software stack anyways.

## Endpoints
The community maintains the following endpoints for the public to interact with the EOS EVM.

Endpoint | Mainnet | Testnet | Notes
--- | :---: | :---: | ---
API | `api.evm.eosnetwork.com` | `api.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com` | RPC API for tools like [Frame](https://frame.sh), [MetaMask](https://metamask.io), and [Rabby](https://rabby.io) to interact with the EOS EVM without running a full node.
Bridge | [bridge.evm.eosnetwork.com](https://bridge.evm.eosnetwork.com) | [bridge.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com](https://bridge.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com) | Trustless bridge to move EOS tokens between the native chain and the EVM.
Explorer | [explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com](https://explorer.evm.eosnetwork.com) | [explorer.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com](https://explorer.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com) | Block explorer and transaction viewer, running a [fork](https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/blockscout) of [Blockscout](https://www.blockscout.com).
Faucet | - | [faucet.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com](https://faucet.testnet.evm.eosnetwork.com) | Obtain EOS tokens for testing. The faucet is run by [EOS Nation](https://eosnation.io).

### Endpoint Health Check
Tests used to determine if endpoints are healthy live [here](./endpoint-health-check.md).
